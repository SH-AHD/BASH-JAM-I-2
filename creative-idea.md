- Idea name: funnyThing

By: Ali Ahmed

Description: A script that displays a random meme (image or video) from a "meme-base" (Like how with data we have data-base, code -> code-base, etc). What makes this special is that you can add any image/video to the meme-base and you can divide the it into folders if you wish (like how I have "programmingMemes" in the example). The script is designed to be bound to a keyboard shortcut for quick access, providing brief moments of entertainment or stress relief during intense study or work sessions.

Input: None
Output: A meme that appears on the top-right corner of the screen

NOTE: This idea was meant to be originally used with crontabs to display memes every 5 minutes but unfortunately running a GUI app with crontabs is very complicated

Idea Name: Battery Alert (Rofi-based)

By: [Shahd Sameh](https://github.com/SH-AHD)

Describe the idea: A critical safety script designed for laptops with severely degraded batteries. The script acts as a "Software UPS" by monitoring battery levels in real-time and triggering a highly intrusive, unmissable Rofi-based GUI alert when the charger is disconnected, or the battery hits a critical threshold. This prevents abrupt power loss, which is essential for protecting NVMe SSDs from controller failure and data corruption (especially when the kernel is unstable).

Input: * Real-time battery percentage and AC adapter status (via acpi).

Customizable threshold (e.g., 60% due to rapid battery drain).

User interaction to dismiss the Rofi alert.

Output: * A persistent, centered GUI popup (Rofi) that stays on top of all windows.
 
Immediate visual warning to plug in the charger.

Protection of the unsafe_shutdowns count on the NVMe drive.

NOTE: This script was developed as a survival tool for a Dell with a severely degraded battery after a kernel-induced hardware scare. While traditional power managers exist, they are often too subtle for a battery that can die in seconds. This script ensures the developer has enough time to save their code and perform a graceful shutdown.
